                        Hi! I'm Pride, I'm a Computer Science major but I'm also minoring in Biology. But that's not the only thing about me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I LOVE films. If I weren't studying CS or bio, I would've gone to film school. My favorite film is <b>Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022)</b>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm also a bit of a big time scientist. I'm currently involved in a research mission where we are trying to save the world's largest flower!
                        I'm currently coauthoring a paper to be published in 2025. You might see me there!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am also writing a preprint paper on research that I've done about harnessing large language models to predict the genus of an angiosperm--or a flowering plant--based
                        on its morphology and phenotype. I'm hoping to submit it to a journal soon!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That's about it for now!
                    </p>
